This is mainly for Weekend Managers:

How to change active days on the announcement chip.
1. Open the file "activedays.json" in a text editor.
2. Add the three letter name of the day to the list, for example:
	To add monday to the active list, append "mon"
	so the list changes from ["sat", "sun"] to ["sat", "sun", "mon"].
	other days can be added in the same way, note that all entries in
	this list must be surrounded by quotation marks and seperated by commas. (Order does not matter)
3. Now upload the changes to the board, this is either done by double clicking the file called upload.bat, 
   or by double clicking the patch.bat file. (DO NOT USE patch.bat if you are not Ben pls)
4. Provided no errors popped up at any point, it is now patched and will run announcements on the provided days.
